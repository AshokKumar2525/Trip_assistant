## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm (v9+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd react_app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### For the frontend (React):

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### For the backend (Express):

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Frontend (React)

```bash
cd ../client
npm run dev
```

Visit the app at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 4. Start the Backend (Express API)

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd server
npm start # or node server.js
```

The backend will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 5. Environment Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Environment variables are required for the application to work properly.

#### Step 1: Copy Sample Files

Both `client` and `server` directories contain `.env.sample` files with all required variables:

```bash
# Copy sample files to create your environment configuration
cp client/.env.sample client/.env
cp server/.env.sample server/.env
```

#### Step 2: Configure Server Environment Variables

Edit `server/.env` with your actual values:

```env
# Database Configuration (Required)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password_here
DB_NAME=tripPlannerDB

# API Keys (Required for full functionality)
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Step 3: Configure Client Environment Variables

Edit `client/.env` with your actual values:

```env
# Weather API (Required for weather functionality)
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here

# Backend API URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

#### API Keys Setup Guide

**📸 Pexels API (Required for Images):**
1. Visit [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add to `server/.env` as `PEXELS_API_KEY`

**🌤️ OpenWeatherMap API (Required for Weather):**
1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add to `client/.env` as `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY`

**🗄️ Database Setup:**
- Install MySQL locally or use a cloud service
- Create a database named `tripPlannerDB`
- Update database credentials in `server/.env`

> **🔐 Security Note:** Never commit `.env` files to version control. The `.env.sample` files are templates - your actual `.env` files with real credentials should remain local only.
>
> **Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits:**
> ```gitignore
> # Ignore environment variable files
> .env
> ```

**For GSSoC Contributors:**

**Option 1: Use Shared API Key (Recommended for GSSoC)**

- Use the existing API key provided by the project maintainer
- Add the shared API key to the `.env` file as `PIXELS_API_KEY`
- This is the recommended approach for GSSoC contributors
- Note: Rate limits are shared across all contributors

**Option 2: Get Your Own API Key (Optional)**

- Sign up at [Pixels API](https://pixels.com/api) to get your own API key
- Add your personal API key to the `.env` file as `PIXELS_API_KEY`
- Benefits: Higher rate limits, no sharing with other users
- Free tier available with limited requests per month
- Use this if you plan to work extensively on image-related features

**API Usage:**

- The API is used for high-quality travel destination images
- Rate limits: Check Pixels API documentation for current limits
- Images are cached to minimize API calls

> **Note:**
>
> - Ensure your MongoDB server is running and update the backend connection string as needed (see `server/server.js`).
> - The application uses a custom authentication system, no external auth provider setup required.
> - Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control.
